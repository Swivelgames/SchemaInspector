Schema Inspector
===============

Very simple microdata analyzer.

Contains a simple UI, accessible via Web Inspector Console by executing the following:
```
SchemaInspector.run;
new SchemaUI();
```

However, this process will be streamlined in the very near future. The Inspector will be configurable, have a much more pleasing UI theme, and will welcome interaction via the Console using straightforward methods and functions.

Future features include coordinating with Schema.org specs to provide insight into the validity of certain microdata constructions.
